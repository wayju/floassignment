# Take home assignment for Flo

## Description

Console application for importing basic data from an NEM12 file. 

### Language Choice
I have used Typescript because I was interested in expericing batch operations in Node.js. Unless a team had an intention to only use or primarily use typescript I would prefer a language intended for highly concurrent processing. Personally for me this would be golang or c#. Python would also be a good choice being a popular tool for data pipelines.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
* Docker if running with Docker, or otherwise, 
* Node.js >= v16.
* Bash (mac / linux) if using the helper script to upload/fetch files from the application in docker
